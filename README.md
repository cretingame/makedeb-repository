# Cretingame's Makedeb Repository

Debian is an amazing Linux distribution, which is very stable. Its stability is due to keep old but well tested packages. Once I wanted to get recent features from some favorite application, I was quickly stuck because I needed application versions that was not provide by the debian package manager. Hence, I used makedeb to install a newer version of neovim and spaceship.
